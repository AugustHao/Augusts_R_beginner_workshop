### Introduction

Hi people, 

Feeling alone in the long and hard struggle against R? I got u fam  

Actually I don't, I'm still struggling everyday and probably will struggle for the rest of my life, but  c'est la vie so I thought why not put together some materials and knowledge (which I've stolen from smarter people) for the benefits of all? (I'm a filthy commie I know)  

So here we go, in this repository you will find materials on different topics in beginner's R, and hopefully they can help you to struggle ever so slightly less with the nightmare that is R, but hey at least you are now officially above the plebs still using Excel or SPSS! (laughing at them is the only way I get any sense of self-validation, please don't judge me)  

### Resources

Here are some links to basic materials that I find helpful about R. I **highly recommend** going through the free online course link (link no.2) before trying on any of the topics. It will give you a lot of basic knowledge on what to do with data and it's very quick to do, don't be afraid!  

1. two books on learning R [*R Programming for Data Science* by Roger D. Peng](http://www.cs.upc.edu/~robert/teaching/estadistica/rprogramming.pdf), and [Jones, Owen, Robert Maillardet, and Andrew Robinson. *Introduction to scientific programming and simulation using R.* CRC Press, 2014.](https://www-taylorfrancis-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au/books/9781420068740) (link is unimelb only). -- never read the first one myself but it's online and free! Second one is written by unimelb researchers and is quite old fashioned (in a sense that it was meant for base R without any Graphical frontend such as Rstudio we all use today, and it covered a lot of basics of programming, the 101010110001 stuff), I quite liked the obscure details they covered, but it's a challenging read I find.
2. [**a free online course for basics in R**](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) (data types, formats, basic operators etc.) -- this is a very good starter course for absolute newbies
3. a book on data handling [*R for Data Science* by Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html). -- you will hear the name Hadley Wickham a lot in R communities, he's basically a God of R who's making a better version of all of R's basic functionalities. That being said you can often get away without using any of his packages, I barely touched any of the fancy Hadleyverse packages myself but if your project is data heavy it will come in handy for you.
4. [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) -- a R package for interactively learning R
5. [Wonderful R basics workshop material](https://nikkirubinstein.gitbooks.io/resguides-introductory-r-workshop/content/content/01-rstudio-intro.html) provided by the Research Bazaar's R workshop -- they also run free R beginner workshops monthly at unimelb, make sure to check them out!
6. [Material for another amazing R workshop created by QAEco's own Elise Gould, thanks Elise!](https://github.com/egouldo/VicBioCon17_data_wrangling) -- this is meant mostly for using R to handle data (importing, organising, cleaning, and analysing), and extensively uses Hadleyverse packages, imo it's a must for anyone into using Hadleyverse  
7. [Some readings on how to better interpret R error messages](https://methodsblog.wordpress.com/2018/01/26/r-errors/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wordpress%2Fmethodsblog+%28methods.blog%29)

### Topics

I'm hoping to cover a few topics relevant to R beginners in this repository, they are not in particular order, although I will naturally start with easier topics first. If there is any topic that you would like to contribute on, please feel free to do so!  

As this is a noob-level thing, I'm not intending on covering stuff in great details, and I hope to often point you to better written guides about how to do stuff, cause I'm too lazy to write them myself and I'll probably such anyway.


***

The list of topics are:  

* Project scaffolding and manual version control --- completed 03/03/2017

* Basic data cleaning and organising in R (we won't be covering this in detail as it's a massive topic) --- completed 26/07/2017

* Loops/statements (your "if, for, and while" stuff)

* Writing functions

* Making pretty figures using ```ggplot```

* Introducing miscellaneous R packages that you might find useful

**tl;dr** here's some stuff that might help you learn R
