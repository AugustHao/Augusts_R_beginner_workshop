# August's R beginner workshop
materials for beginner's level R self-learning/workshops using Rstudio

###Introduction

Hi people,

As I've shared this idea with you before, I think we could all benefit from knowledge-sharing based workshops on R language using Rstudio. Many of us use R for analyzing our data, and although types of data can be very different, I think some general R skills can be useful in dealing with all sorts of scenarios.  

Therefore, I've started this R project, with the intention of collecting R learning materials and making them available for all of us. In the future I will also be looking into running face-to-face workshops on R, if we decide that sort of things would be good. Furthermore, I will also write instructions (in a few days) on how you could contribute to this project by uploading your own materials, if you decide to do so.  

All right, down to business, here are some links to basic materials that I find helpful about R. I **highly recommend** going through the free online course link before trying on any of the topics. It will give you a lot of basic knowledge on what to do with data and it's very quick to do, don't be afraid!  

1. two books on learning R [*R Programming for Data Science* by Roger D. Peng](http://www.cs.upc.edu/~robert/teaching/estadistica/rprogramming.pdf), and [Jones, Owen, Robert Maillardet, and Andrew Robinson. *Introduction to scientific programming and simulation using R.* CRC Press, 2014.](http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~odj/Teaching/MAST30025/spuRs_reformatted_part1.pdf). 
2. [a free online course for basics in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) (data types, formats, basic operators etc.)
3. [a useful cheatsheet on Rmarkdown](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) (we will go through what Rmarkdown is in one of the first topics).

###Topics

Throughout this project I'm hoping to cover the following topics, they are not in particular order, although I will naturally start with easier topics first. If there is any topic that you would like to contribute on, please feel free to do so! It can be on doing a particular kind of analysis, presenting nice visuals, or introducing a R package. Feel free to include links to external useful sources if you like, just remember that this is a project in public domain, and you should be careful with copyrighted materials (which will be very unlikely to come across).  

Also, remember this is an introductory level thing, which means that we won't be able to cover all problems in each topics, and I expect the topics to be very elementary at start anyway. After all, this is a project that I hope we will build on and expand together over time.  

***

The list of topics are:  

* Project scaffolding and manual version control

* Version control using GitHub (which will familiarise you with how to contribute to this repository)

* Basics of Rmarkdown

* Basic data cleaning and organising in R (we won't be covering this in detail as it's a massive topic)

* Descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing (this would be a very short one)

* Linear model(lm)

* Generalised linear model(glm); GLMs are more complicated than LMs and they allow for more complex relationships, they are also a good starting point for learning other modelling algorithms

* Model evaluation (goodness of fit/validation using predictions etc.)

* Loops

* Operating with GIS (will cover rasters only)

* Spatial point processes

* Making pretty figures using *ggplot*

* Data manipulation using *tidyverse*

* Introducing miscellaneous R packages that you might find useful 

* Species Distribution Modelling (only basics, I don't know model tuning well either)  

***

This is gonna take a lot of time to finish of course, but once it does, hopefully we will have a share resource that will help all of us to learn R and maybe even future students. I'll keep updating things from time to time, be on the look out for updates!  


Cheers
August
